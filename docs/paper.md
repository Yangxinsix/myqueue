# Summary

Task scheduling and workload management on high-performance computing
environments is usually done with tools such as `SLURM` [@slurm].
[MyQueue](https://myqueue.readthedocs.io/) is a front-end for schedulers that
makes handling of tasks easy. It has a command-line interface called *mq* with
a number of sub-commands and a Python interface for managing workflows.
Currently, the following schedulers are supported:
[SLURM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager),
[PBS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System), and
[LSF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF).

The idea behind `MyQueue` is to define a virtual user specific queue that the
user can interact with in an easy and efficient way while `MyQueue` handles
the interaction with the scheduler.  Finished tasks will stay in the virtual
queue until they are explicitly removed so they can be listed with their
status (done, failed, timed-out or out-of-memory). This makes it easy to keep
track of your tasks: If a task is listed as "done" it reminds you that some
action should be taken, e.g. the result of the task should be checked. If a
task failed then you need to fix something and resubmit the task.  In this
sense, `MyQueue` works as a to-do list.

`MyQueue` has a very convenient *list* sub-command.  It will by default only
show tasks belonging to the current folder and its sub-folders making it easy
to manage several projects by putting them in separate folders.  Failed tasks
will show a short error message read from the relevant line in the error file.
You can select the tasks you want to list by status, task-id, name or error
message. A task can be marked with a *restarts* number $N$, indicating that
`MyQueue` should restart the task up to $N$ times (with increased resources)
if the task runs out of time or memory. Increased resources means longer time
or more cores for the timed-out and out-of-memory cases, respectively.

The `MyQueue` *submit* sub-command makes it easy to submit thousands
of tasks in a single command. As input *submit* takes a shell script, Python
script or Python module and executes the script/module in a number of folders.
This makes it easy to submit a large number of tasks quickly. The *list* sub-
command can then be used to monitor the execution of the tasks. Together with
the *resubmit* sub-command it becomes easy to resubmit any tasks that might
have failed. In this way the sub-commands of `MyQueue` synergize and greatly
increase the efficiency of the user.

`MyQueue` has a powerful Python interface that can be used to define
workflows. A Python script defines a dependency tree of tasks that `MyQueue`
can use to submit tasks without user involvement. The dependencies take the
form "if task X is done then submit task Y".  `MyQueue` works directly with
folders and files, which makes it simple to use and easy to get started -- no
system administrator or central database server is needed.

`MyQueue` is particularly useful for high-throughput computations, which
require automatic submission of thousands of interdependent
jobs. For example, `MyQueue` has been used successfully to drive high-
throughput screening studies coordinating on the order of 100,000 individual
tasks [@c2db], [@felix].  `MyQueue` is also used by the [Atomic Simulation
Recipes](https://asr.readthedocs.io/) project, which is a library of tasks for
atomic simulations.

Being essentially a frontend for schedulers `MyQueue` distinguishes it
from existing workflow software [@aiida][@fireworks] in several
ways. By implementing its queue locally, meaning that each user will
have its own queue, no central database is needed. Furthermore, using
the `MyQueue` *init* sub-command new queues can be initalized which
can be used to separate jobs pertaining to different projects. This
makes `MyQueue`s design fundamentally decentralized which makes it
easier to handle multiple projects simultaneously.
